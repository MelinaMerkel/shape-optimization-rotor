# rotor optimization
This repository contains data and Matlab/Octave code to generate the images from the paper "Shape Optimization of Rotating Electric Machines using Isogeometric Analysis and Harmonic Stator-Rotor Coupling" and the original and optimized rotor geometry

* run "figures" in Octave/Matlab to generate the images from the paper
* import IGES files "stator.igs", "rotor\_original.iga" and "rotor\_optimized.igs" to CAE software to see stator and rotor geometry
